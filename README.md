## Book Reviewer Rails Project

This rails app provides a way that users can keep track of books that they have read and write reviews for them. They can also see reviews done by other users. The users can also create catalogs to keep a list of books in order to organize them for their own benefit.

- Clone the repo<br>
- Run bundle install<br>
